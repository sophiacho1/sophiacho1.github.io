The FCC‚Äôs approach to net neutrality, however, has swung back and forth as the partisan makeup of FCC leadership changes according to the presidential party. In this article, I delve into what net neutrality is, how the FCC has oscillated on net neutrality rules under different administrations in the past two decades, and how bipartisan Congressional legislation can bring this net neutrality pendulum to rest for the best interests of consumers, internet service providers, and the entire internet ecosystem.","tags":[],"title":"The Federal Communications Commission‚Äôs Net Neutrality Pendulum: Bipartisan Congressional Legislation Can Stop It","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1651881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651881600,"objectID":"d136f74e4e1ef06ebe7c7b3a50759db7","permalink":"https://sophiacho1.github.io/talk/classifying-sounds/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/classifying-sounds/","section":"event","summary":"Trained logistic regression, KNN, and random forest models to classify sounds around NYC as accurately as possible.

Under the current criminal justice system, however, virtual sexual assault is not considered a crime as there is no ‚Äúreal‚Äù physical contact. In this article, I argue that since immersive VR tricks users into thinking that their virtual experience is real, virtual sexual assault still feels like ‚Äúreal‚Äù sexual assault and has real negative psychological consequences. As providers of VR platforms are failing to confront virtual sexual assault effectively, it is imperative that legislators establish proper VR criminal law to make the virtual world a safer place for everyone.","tags":[],"title":"Sexual Assault in Immersive Virtual Reality: Criminal Law Must Keep Up with Technology","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1639094400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639094400,"objectID":"d29d26afbb29a4f15aa6d0a6d2456638","permalink":"https://sophiacho1.github.io/talk/impact-of-covid-19-on-education/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/impact-of-covid-19-on-education/","section":"event","summary":"Examined the relationship between primary and secondary school students‚Äô internet connectivity and engagement with school using data from UNICEF.
